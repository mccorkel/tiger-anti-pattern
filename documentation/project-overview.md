# Project Overview: Tiger Anti-Pattern Detection

## **Vision Statement**
The **Tiger Anti-Pattern Detection** project aims to enhance learning efficiency and academic integrity by using AI-driven video analysis to detect and classify student behaviors in real-time. By identifying anti-patterns such as distractions, ineffective study habits, and potential cheating behaviors, the system provides actionable insights to educators, helping create a more effective learning environment.

## **Main Goals**
1. **Accurately Detect Student Behaviors**
   - Identify time spent on learning apps and categorize engagement levels.
2. **Enhance Study Efficiency**
   - Provide feedback to students regarding their study habits to maximize effective learning time.
3. **Ensure Academic Integrity**
   - Monitor assessments and flag potential cheating behaviors.
4. **Automate AI Model Training**
   - Use annotated datasets to continuously improve model accuracy.
5. **Provide Actionable Insights**
   - Generate reports and analytics for educators and institutions to optimize student engagement.

## **Problem Statement**
Digital learning environments present several challenges:
- **Lack of Visibility into Student Engagement:** Educators struggle to determine whether students are actively engaged in learning or distracted by non-learning activities.
- **Time Inefficiency:** Students may unknowingly waste time on distractions, reducing learning effectiveness.
- **Academic Integrity Risks:** Remote learning and online assessments increase opportunities for dishonest behavior, making it harder to maintain fair evaluations.

## **Proposed Solution**
The **Tiger Anti-Pattern Detection** system provides:
- **A Training Product** to label and refine training datasets using real-world student videos.
- **A Video Detection Engine** leveraging AWS Rekognition to analyze video frames and detect predefined anti-pattern behaviors.
- **A Web-Based Dashboard** for reviewing detected behaviors, analyzing trends, and improving AI model accuracy.

By integrating **AI-driven event detection, user-friendly annotation tools, and scalable cloud-based processing**, the solution ensures accurate and real-time behavior classification to support improved learning outcomes and academic integrity.
